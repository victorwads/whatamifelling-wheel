## 📖 The Story Behind It

### 🇧🇷 Português
Eu sempre tive dificuldade em me comunicar e expressar meus sentimentos durante toda a minha vida. Até que conheci uma pessoa maravilhosa, que hoje é meu namorado. Para a minha surpresa, com ele a comunicação fluiu de forma incrivelmente fácil.

Logo nos primeiros dias em que nos conhecemos, mostrei a ele a "Roda dos Sentimentos" e ele se empolgou de verdade. Nossa comunicação pelo WhatsApp muitas vezes consistia em pegar a imagem da roda e desenhar círculos com a canetinha do celular para mostrar um ao outro o que estávamos sentindo naquele exato momento. Isso nos ajudou a nos entender profundamente.

Um belo dia, estávamos assistindo à série *Uma Advogada Extraordinária* (Netflix). Em um momento muito tocante, ele cuidou de mim, eu chorei muito e, de repente, não fazia ideia do que estava sentindo. Foi então que ele, com toda a sua empolgação, sentou comigo e comecei a programar esta Roda dos Sentimentos interativa com apoio dele.

O objetivo era simples: ter uma ferramenta onde pudéssemos selecionar, exportar e compartilhar nossos sentimentos muito mais rápido do que ficar desenhando na tela do celular. E assim, com muito amor e código, nasceu este projeto. ❤️

### 🇺🇸 English
Throughout my life, I've always found it difficult to communicate and express my feelings. That was until I met a wonderful person, who is now my boyfriend. To my surprise, communicating with him was incredibly easy.

In the very early days of getting to know each other, I showed him the "Emotion Wheel" and he genuinely loved it. Our WhatsApp conversations often involved taking a picture of the wheel and drawing circles on it with the phone's markup tool just to show each other what we were feeling at that exact moment. It helped us understand each other deeply.

One beautiful day, we were watching the show *Extraordinary Attorney Woo* on Netflix. During a very touching moment, he took care of me, I cried a lot, and suddenly, I had no idea what I was feeling. That's when he enthusiastically sat down with me and I started coding this interactive Emotion Wheel with his support.

The goal was simple: to build a tool where we could select, export, and share our feelings much faster than drawing on a phone screen. And just like that, with a lot of love and code, this project was born. ❤️
